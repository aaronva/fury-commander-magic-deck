		CD: I like tony stark but I would think of him as changing his equipment quickly to suit the situation rather than loading up on everything. maybe a 2: unequip all equipment then equip an equipment you control?
		CD: Also don't think the prowess Is needed here either given the strong equipment flavor but I’d say it matches the character.
		AV: Removed prowess

		CD: Still not a huge fan of the 5 color tutor activation but I don't know what else to suggest.
		AV: Looking for another good way to signify leadership.
		AV: Made him all colors and removed tutor for legend. Now gives legends vigilance because some legends in the deck like attacking
		AV: Trying WUBRG reduction instead. I think it’s over powered, but I’d like to try it.
		AV: Trying a version of Fury designed with the goal of helping to finish the game.
