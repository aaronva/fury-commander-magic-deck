		CD: I like tony stark but I would think of him as changing his equipment quickly to suit the situation rather than loading up on everything. maybe a 2: unequip all equipment then equip an equipment you control?
		CD: Also don't think the prowess Is needed here either given the strong equipment flavor but I’d say it matches the character.
		AV: Removed prowess
